# ISO 27001 Audit

Auditing is a critical component of ISO 27001 compliance. It involves:

1. **Internal Audits**: Conducted by the organization to assess the ISMS.
2. **External Audits**: Conducted by an independent certification body to verify compliance.

## Internal Audit Process

- **Plan the Audit**: Define the scope and objectives.
- **Conduct the Audit**: Gather evidence and assess compliance.
- **Report Findings**: Document and report any non-conformities.
- **Implement Corrective Actions**: Address non-conformities and improve the ISMS.

## External Audit Process

- **Stage 1 Audit**: Preliminary evaluation of the ISMS documentation.
- **Stage 2 Audit**: Detailed assessment of the implementation and effectiveness of the ISMS.
